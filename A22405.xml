            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>❧ By the King. ¶ A Proclamation for the better furnishing of the Nauy, and increase of Shipping.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the small allowance of Pay to the Sailers</hi> seruing in the Kings Shippes, is obserued to be a chiefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion why the said Shippes haue not beene, nor could bee so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and so well Manned as is requisite, both for His Maiesties seruice, and the good of the State, especially in these times, when they are to be imployed for the repressing and pursuing of forreine enemies, infesting the Coasts, and endammaging His Maiesties Subiects, as also in regard of other important seruices, Which being propounded by the Lord Admirall to the rest of the Lords of His Maiesties Priuie Counsell at the Board, and it being mooued by his Lordship, that with their approbation His Maiestie might bee mooued, that the <hi>Medium</hi> of allowance for euery Sayler might be Twentie shillings a Moneth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now it is but fourteene shillings, By which meanes there will accrue to euery ordinary man Fourteene shillings a Moneth, besides an allowance out of it, of foure pence to a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, two pence to a Barber, and sixe pence a Moneth to the Chest, whereas the ordinary men haue now but Nine shillings foure pence a Moneth, and no allowance at all giuen to a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, Out of the surplusage of which proportion now mooued to be increased, all Officers wages would be likewise respectiuely raised, and allowance also might be giuen for a Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and a Corporall. Which motion so made by the Lord Admirall, the rest of the Lords hauing taken into their serious consideration, and well weighed both the proportion and the reasons whereupon it was grounded, did thinke it very fit that His Maiestie should be mooued therein, to the end His Maiestie might bee pleased to Command that the same might be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly put in execution.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:28598:2"/>
            <p>And His Maiestie, being thereupon mooued by the Lords of His Priuie Counsell, out of His gracious disposition to encourage the poore Saylers cheerefully, and faithfully to serue Him, Hath beene well pleased to enlarge the Entertainement, and Allowance heeretofore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Saylers; And doeth hereby publish and declare, and doeth also promise and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, That from hencefoorth euery Sayler, which shall be imployed in any of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Ships, shall haue such allowance made, and duely payd vnto him, as was propounded by the Lord Admirall, as aforesayd. And His Maiestie, by the like aduice of His Priuie Counsell, doth straitly charge and command, That no Merchants, or Owners of Ships, shall draw away any Saylers, by enhaunsing of their pay, lest thereby His Maiesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and the Seruice of the Publique, doe suffer preiudice: Neuerthelesse, His Maiestie is very well contented, That they who trade into very remote Countreyes, as into <hi>Muscouia,</hi> and more particularly, they of the <hi>East India</hi> Company, (who cannot alwayes furnish their Shippes with men at ordinary Rates, for Voyages of that length and danger) may haue libertie to vse meanes for the accommodating of themselues in that behalfe, in the best manner they can.</p>
            <p>And lastly, whereas in the time of the reigne of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, for the better encouraging of the Ship-masters, and Merchants, to build Ships, there was an Order made, for the allowance of Fiue Shillings a Tunne to euery Ship aboue the burthen of one hundred Tunnes, which should afterwards be built: Which Order was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same reason reuiued by His late Maiestie of euer blessed memorie, King <hi>Iames;</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie being desirous to giue all encouragement, for the encreasing of the number and strength of the Shippes of this Kingdome, by the like aduice of His Priuie Counsell, Is well pleased, and doeth hereby publish and declare, and doeth promise and vndertake, That His Maiestie, for and vnto euery Ship, which shall from hencefoorth bee built, of the burthen of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Tunnes or vpwards, shall and will giue, and duely pay an allowance of Fiue Shillings for euery Tunne.</p>
